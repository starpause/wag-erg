you can even [play with it in your browser](http://starpause.com/WagErgWeb.swf)!

INSTRUCTIONS:

  1. click add sound
  1. randomize the sound's color and sequence if u like
  1. click the radar to go back to the black screen to add more sounds

my goal was to make something i could boot up and in under a minute, make an ambient/abstract/idm loop ... which is done!

v2 features are safe kept in my head ♘♞♘♞ but code review & contributions are welcome ♡∴♥∴♡

sounds are randomized using [SFXR](http://www.superflashbros.net/as3sfxr/).

sequences are randomized using the [EUCLIDEAN ALGORITHM](http://ruinwesen.com/blog?id=216). thanks to Robin Prince for sharing his <a href='http://registeringdomainnamesismorefunthandoingrealwork.com/blogs/?p=236'>javascript implementation</a>.

thanks to <a href='http://alumican.net/'>alumican</a> for his beatdispatcher class via the deep <a href='http://www.libspark.org/wiki/WikiStart/en'>libspark</a> library.

WAG IT UP !! ! !
